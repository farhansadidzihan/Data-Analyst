# Machine Learning Roadmap 

![2020 machine learning roadmap overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/machine-learning-roadmap/master/2020-ml-roadmap-overview.png?token=AD7ZOCOIG7IZXHDL63W6RZK7A3B6I)

A roadmap connecting many of the most important concepts in machine learning, how to learn them and what tools to use to perform them.

Namely:

1. ü§î **Machine Learning Problems** - what does a machine learning problem look like?
2. ‚ôªÔ∏è **Machine Learning Process** - once you‚Äôve found a problem, what steps might you take to solve it?
3. üõ† **Machine Learning Tools** - what should you use to build your solution?
4. üßÆ **Machine Learning Mathematics** - what exactly is happening under the hood of all the machine learning code you're writing?
5. üìö **Machine Learning Resources** - okay, this is cool, how can I learn all of this?

See the [full interactive version](https://dbourke.link/mlmap).

Many of the materials in this roadmap were inspired by [Daniel Formoso](https://github.com/dformoso)'s [machine learning mindmaps](https://github.com/dformoso/machine-learning-mindmap),so if you enjoyed this one, go and check out his. He also has a mindmap specifically for [deep learning](https://github.com/dformoso/deeplearning-mindmap) too.

**Learning Tip 1 üíÅ**: If you're are a beginnner and not able to answer interview questions, it's totally ok, you can look upto the solutions and solve similar types of problems on your own to practice those types of questions. You don't need to learn every concept, if you're not able to understand it, just skip it and move on to the next topic and review next day or try to get help from communities such as discord communities.

**Interview Tip 1 üíÅ**: While answering questions, try to explain in such a way that you're building your solution from base, if you know the answer, start with explaining how you reached to that answer, don't tell your answer, explain your thought process. Interviews wants to check your problem solving skills. Even if you give wrong answer but your thought process is correct, interviewer might be impressed.

**Learning Tip 2 üíÅ**: If you're a beginner and learning python, it will require time to reiterate several times to understand a concept, & trust me it's totally worth it. As said learning Data science requires time and learning the hard way rather than shortcuts which will make you nowhere. So, don't get demotivated if you're not able to understand a concept, just keep trying and you'll get it.

**Learning Tip 3 üíÅ**: Data structures and algorithms is becoming one of the important topics in data science interview as well in giant companies, so it's important to learn it. Not only from the perspective of interviews, learning it and solving problems using dsa makes your problem solving skill and criticial thinking much more better than before and you will be having several tools in your toolbox to solve any problem. So I suggest to learn a particular topic and solve several questions on it, we will soon be adding several problems on this page to practice for data science.

## Core Data Science Fundamentals üöÄ

According to [Harvard business School](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-science-skills), Data science is the process of deriving meaningful insights from raw data. Data science aims to make sense of the copious amounts of data, also referred to as big data, that today‚Äôs organizations maintain.

**Learning Tip 4 üíÅ**: Learning frameworks is not a big deal, but the way you use frameworks to analyze data, visualize data and solve problems is what matters. So, I suggest to understand the CRUX of data analysis and data visualization and use the frameworks to build your solution. If you don't know the actual CRUX of data visualization, analysis, then there is no point in learning frameworks. and If you don't know how to work with data, then there is no point in learning ML.

Note: People usually have question around learning Big data tools in initial phases of data science, I personally think, it's not necessary to learn big data tools in initial phases of data science, but if you're interested in learning it, you can learn it later on. There are different perspectives on this, i would like you to check out the answers from this [quora answer](https://www.quora.com/Should-a-data-scientist-know-big-data-hadoop).

I have made a separate page for machine learning, you can check it out [here](https://wheat-production-d58.notion.site/ML002-e469d005b2b14d5ba6f8c0bdfd305ded). I also given my personal opinion on machine learning and how to learn it in the most efficient way possible in the form of a video, you can check it out [here](https://youtu.be/Av0oMG49FQE), which got more than 150k views.
